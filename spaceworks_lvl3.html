					<h3>Structural Analysis</h3>
					<p>
                        This course was a bit different from the others in that there were no groups created for the project, everything was done solo.
						In this class, students were taught how to idealize and mesh CAD part files using Siemens NX as well as how to perform structural
						analysis simulation tests on them.

					<h4>Idealization</h4>
                    <p>
                        This section was a bit difficult to master because I needed to understand what the program does and doesn't
						like to work with when meshing. I found that the key to a good idealization is to cut away 
						areas that look structurally insignificant, and reduce simple supporting structures to 2D midsurfaces 
						to reduce computational load. 
                    </p>

					<p>
						In the end, I was able to get a good grasp of how things are done and I'm
						 confident that I can repeat the process in a timely manner for future parts.

					<h4>Meshing</h4>
                    <p>
                        Meshing was another difficult process to understand because, at first, a lot of the errors that NX throws 
						back at you are vague and hard to decipher. After some time, though, I was able to get a proper grasp of how things 
						worked. 
                    </p>
					<img src="SupplementaryFiles/spaceworks_lvl3_mesh.jpg" height="185" width="250" alt="Meshed part">
					<p>
						I used a blend of 2D midsurface meshing and 3D quadrilateral meshing, with some small applications of 3D 
						tetrahedral meshing in areas with complex geometry.
					</p>
                </section>

					<h4>Simulation</h4>
                    <p>
                        This part can take some time to complete. Not because of the amount of work required by the user, but rather
						by the computer. 
                    </p>
					<img src="SupplementaryFiles/spaceworks_lvl3_sim.jpg" height="200" width="250" alt="Simulated part">
					<p>
						I also learned how to properly determine what's wrong with a part's meshing or idealizaion based on 
						the results provided by the simulation. Initially, I found that random parts would "fly away" from the 
						assembly, which produced bad data. I found that this was caused by the program not properly applying 
						mesh mating conditions between the sectioned elements to each part.
